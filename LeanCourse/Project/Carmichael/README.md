## Project description
### Definition
Carmichael numbers are composite number that satisfy Fermat's little theorem i.e. $n>1$ is carmichael if it is composite and for all $a\in \mathbb{Z}$, if $gcd(a,n)=1$ then $a^{n-1}\equiv 1$ (mod $n$).
### Main results
- Korselt's criterion: A composite integer $n > 1$ is a Carmichael number if and only if n is squarefree and for every prime p dividing n, $(p - 1) | (n - 1)$.
- Simplification of the Carmichael numbers' main property: A composite integer $n$ is a Carmichael number if and only if $a^n \equiv a \mod{n}$ for all $a \in \mathbb{Z}$.
- 561 is the smallest Carmichael number.
- Chernick's construction: If $k$ is a positive integer such that $6k + 1$, $12k + 1$, and $18k + 1$ are all prime,
then the product $n = (6k + 1)(12k + 1)(18k + 1)$ is a Carmichael number.
- Other properties of Carmichael numbers: Every Carmichael number $n$ is odd, has at least three different prime factors. and satisfies that every prime factor of $n$ is less than $\sqrt{n}$.

### Unfinished results
No result from the selected ones has been left unfinished, no sorry remains in the code.
